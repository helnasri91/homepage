        From the big apple to Canada and finally situated in Los Angeles city.<br>
        The son of two lovely Sudanese natives whom immigrated to New-York City<br> in 1988.
        Shortly afterwards my family established itself in Montreal and then<br> later Vancouver
        In my youth, I was the IT person(pun intended)<br> and spent a lot of time making websites of
        comics and movies<br> like Dragonball. My father and I worked around a lot of network<br> upgrades
        with hardware from cisco networking systems although most of my assistance<br> was menial.
        We aided the network upgrades of mostly muslims schools<br> and interestingly farms within
        the province of British-Columbia I predominantly<br> worked in restaurants and IT after
        high-school keeping myself curious<br> and hungry I travelled all over North America and
        Recently made a trip to South Korea.<br> Currently I'm community college student in Santa Monica
        with my sights <br>on the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program over at Berkeley or
        Cal State Pomona.<br> Fun facts about me outside of technical interest; I play a mean jazzy blues
        guitar,<br> a decorated amateur boxer, and I speak about 4 languages(human languages). Future        aspirations<br> are to grow professionally in the United States as an engineer and to then take
        what I've learned<br> and apply it globally to places in need, such as my folks' place<br> in the Sudan.
        One of my mantras in terms of growth knowledge<br> and opportunity is to remember, I am not okay
        until we are all okay!
